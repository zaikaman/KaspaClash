Kaspathon: Show Us Your Kode-Fu
Kaspa is one of the fastest Layer 1 PoW blockchain in existence—with block times measured in milliseconds, instant confirmations, and throughput that doesn't make you wait.

This hackathon is your chance to explore what that speed makes possible.

We're inviting builders, students, hackers, and experimenters of all skill levels to create projects that push the boundaries of real-time PoW blockchain. Whether you're building payment systems that feel instant, games where transactions drive the action, IoT applications that anchor data as it happens, or something we haven't imagined yet—we want to see it.

200,000 KAS in prizes across Main, Payments & Commerce, Gaming & Interactive, and Real-Time Data tracks—plus mention prizes for Best UX/UI, Best Beginner Project, Most Creative Use of Kaspa, Best Real-World Application, and Community Favorite.

All projects must be open source, integrate with Kaspa in a meaningful way, and include documentation and a demo. Solo participants and teams are both welcome.

Build something fast. Build something real. Show us your Kode-fu.

Join Kaspa's Community Discord to connect with other participants and get support (on the dedicated Kaspathon channel ).

About Us
Introducing Kaspathon

Kaspathon is organized by passionate members of the Kaspa community who believe in the power of decentralized, high-performance blockchain technology. Our small but dedicated team includes developers, community builders, and blockchain enthusiasts committed to growing the Kaspa ecosystem through open collaboration and innovation.

Why we're doing this: Kaspa represents a fundamental breakthrough in PoW blockchain architecture—a proof-of-work Layer 1 that doesn't sacrifice speed for security. We created this hackathon to showcase what becomes possible when block times are measured in milliseconds instead of minutes, and to invite talented builders from around the world to explore this potential.

Our mission:

Foster innovation within the Kaspa ecosystem
Create educational opportunities for developers at all levels
Generate high-quality open-source projects that benefit everyone
Build bridges between Kaspa and the broader Web3 community
Prove that high-performance infrastructure unlocks entirely new categories of applications
This hackathon is more than a competition—it's an invitation to join a growing community of builders who are rethinking what's possible on Layer 1.

Supported by: The Kaspa community
