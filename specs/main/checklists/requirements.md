# Specification Quality Checklist: Battle Pass & Progression System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: January 7, 2026  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is comprehensive, focused on business value, and ready for the next phase (planning).

**Key Strengths**:
- 10 well-prioritized user stories with independent testability
- 90 detailed functional requirements organized by subsystem
- 18 measurable success criteria focused on user outcomes and business metrics
- Comprehensive edge case analysis
- Clear entity definitions for data modeling
- Thoughtful assumptions documented
- No implementation details - purely focused on WHAT and WHY

**Specification Completeness**: 100%

The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
